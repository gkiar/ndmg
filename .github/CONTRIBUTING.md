### Contributing to ndmg

The requirements we have for contributing code to this project are:
- PEP8 compliant
- Consistent organization with directory structure established
- Sphinx-style autodocs

### Pull Request guidelines
 - Give PR descriptive name based on the code you're merging, not just the branch name
 - Make 1 PR per piece of functionality you're contributing
 - Provide evidence in each PR that what you did works, so that I can streamline my testing
    - show functionality before and after your changes
    - provide figures/summaries as to why I should believe the new code is better
    - if your summaries are not exhaustive and I may want to dig deeper, provide URLs to data I can use to test myself/that you used to test
 - Organize your description in a way that is easier to read
    - styling, indentation, short summaries, etc. as opposed to a wall of multi-line bullets or text that is hard to visually parse
